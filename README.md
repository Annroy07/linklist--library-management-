Library Management using Linklist
# Library Management System

This project is a Library Management System implemented in C, using a linked list to store and manage a collection of books. It provides features for adding, deleting, searching, and listing books, as well as saving and loading book data from a file for persistent storage.


## Features

1. **Add Book**: Allows the user to add a new book by entering the book's ID, title, author, and publication year.
2. **Delete Book**: Enables the user to delete a book from the collection by providing the book's ID.
3. **Search Book**: Allows the user to search for a book by its ID and displays the book's details if found.
4. **List All Books**: Displays all books currently in the collection, showing each bookâ€™s ID, title, author, and publication year.
5. **Save to File**: Saves the current collection of books to a file (`library.txt`), ensuring that data is preserved across sessions.
6. **Load from File**: Loads the collection of books from `library.txt`, restoring previously saved data at the start of the program.
7. **Exit**: Exits the program after saving any updates to the file.
